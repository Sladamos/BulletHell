# Bullet Hell
A C++ game for my undergraduate course - "Basics of programming". SDL library was used with a given template.
## Compilation
:warning: If you want to compile this project you need:
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). library
- Your own bitmaps
- Update the code by changing:
	1. GameObjects' names and their collisions edges	(search by CTRL+F and /gfx)
	2. Distance between painters rows (if you want to add charsets with other sizes)
